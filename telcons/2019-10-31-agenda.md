:bangbang: Means the place/city is observing [Daylight Saving Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/events.html) (DST) at time shown. Between October 27 and November 3, the time difference between US and Europe will be 1 hour less than it currently is. China, Japan and Russia do not observe DST, which means the time difference between these areas and US/Europe will be one hour more than it currently is.
