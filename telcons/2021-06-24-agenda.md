### Agenda

#### ℹ️ WebNN API - First Public Working Draft
- First Public Working Draft (FPWD) publication
- Discuss next steps and milestones on the W3C Recommendation Track

  
#### ℹ️ Supporting implementation efforts: webnn-native and webnn-polyfill

webnn-native and webnn-polyfill are software projects of the Web Machine Learning Community Group. These projects informs the Web Neural Network API specification work and we will review the progress and findings of these project on these Working Group calls from time to time.

- webnn-native and webnn-polyfill introduction to the WG, how to get involved, areas welcoming contributions, Q&A (Ningxin)
- https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn-native
- https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn-polyfill
  
#### ℹ️ WebNN API - TAG review
  
WebNN API has received W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG) review, we discuss and address the remaining open issues:

- [tag-tracker] Define a common term for logical tensor changes?
    - Issue: https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/150
    - PR: WIP (Rama?)
- [tag-tracker] Ergonomics of the JS examples
    - Issue: https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/139
    - PR: WIP - pending concrete TAG feedback to inform the resolution (Sangwhan)
- [tag-tracker] String enum for activations
    - Issue: https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/138
    - PR: WIP - add an informative note to be incorporated into the spec to explain current design principles around activations (Chai)
