#### ℹ️ Meeting logistics update

>Teleconferences: Given good overlap of participants across WG+CG, we plan to repurpose monthly Sydney afternoon CG slots (Wed 04:00-05:00 UTC) for WG+CG topics when there's demand. This slot will be in addition to the normal WG bi-weekly (Thu 14:00-15:00 UTC) and caters specifically to our participants from APAC time zones.

>TPAC: The Web Machine Learning Working Group's hybrid TPAC meeting is canceled due to key participants' inability to attend the in-person meeting.
