#### ℹ️ Announcements
  
- Revised Ethical Principles for Web Machine Learning and associated workshop update
  
#### ℹ️ Security considerations - last call for review

> Review the PR that is the group's response to security questions from Chrome Security team.

- [ ] issue: General Security Questions: https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/241
- [ ] PR: Update Security Considerations per review feedback: https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/pull/251
- [ ] All security-tracker issues: https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues?q=label%3Asecurity-tracker+

#### ℹ️ Context-based graph execution methods for different threading models

> Review the new proposal for context-based graph execution methods that is an improved design and considers feedback received from the group for the earlier proposal.

- [ ] issue: Should WebNN support async APIs? https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/230
- [ ] PR: Context-based graph execution methods for different threading models https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/pull/257

#### ℹ️ Integration with real-time video processing
  
> Introduce and discuss the background blur sample that uses mediacapture-transform, WebGL and WebGPU/WebNN processing pipelines, introduce WebNN Chromium prototype that implements WebNN/WebGPU interop API
  
- [ ] issue: Integration with real-time video processing https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/226
- [ ] prototype: Video processing with insertable streams [main thread version](https://huningxin.github.io/webrtc-samples/src/content/insertable-streams/video-processing/), [worker version](https://huningxin.github.io/webrtc-samples/src/content/insertable-streams/video-processing-worker/)
  - Note: WebGPU/WebNN processing pipeline requires WebNN Chromium protype https://github.com/huningxin/chromium-src/releases/tag/webnn_102.0.4955.0
  
#### ℹ️ Candidate Recommendation proposed new features

> CR expectation is that the spec is considered technically complete and fit for purpose. Review the new proposed CR issues targeting this milestone. Discuss any blockers or new information that might suggest we need to adjust our scope and/or timeline.

Proposed new CR issues:
- [ ] WebNN should support int8 quantized models https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/128
- [ ] WebNN / WebGPU interop https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2500


(All "cr" issues https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/labels/cr)
